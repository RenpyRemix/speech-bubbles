# Speech Bubbles

So, you want a system where each line of dialogue can appear at a set position in a frame that looks like a comic book speech bubble?

You want all the normal Ren'Py dialogue things to still work... translation, styles, text tags, extend and everything else related to the line of speech.

You want the ability to show multiple bubbles at once, styled differently and you want a system that makes it easy to specify the settings for each line.
