# Frames & Styles

The bulk of the system relies on subscreens that include a frame which contains the dialogue text. For longer text strings we want the frame background to get larger. For shorter text strings we want that background to shrink. Other than specifying a minimum size, we let the shown background expand to fit the text, forcing it to use linebreaks by just setting a maximum width.

First we need to make sure the text itself uses some specific style settings though.
